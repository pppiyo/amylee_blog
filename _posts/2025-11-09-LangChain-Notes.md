# LangChain
A **context-aware reasoning application framework** designed to act as a "**glue**" connecting various technologies in the large language model ecosystem. Structurally, it consists of a **component layer encompassing tools like abstract models and vector stores, and an end-to-end chain layer that assembles components for specific applications such as document or SQL querying**. The framework supports over 700 integrations and is offered in both Python and TypeScript versions. 

## Development
Recognizing a developer's need for greater control, the LangChain team created **LangGraph**, which **offers lower-level orchestration capabilities for building customized agent logic**.

Currently, the company maintains three product lines: open-source **LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith**, each focusing on different priorities like ecosystem scaling, improved agent scalability, and production workload management, respectively.

### **LangChain**
- Open-source ecosystem, the core responsibility lies in **scaling ecosystem management**, which involves close collaboration with a large number of partners.
### **LangGraph**
- Current efforts are focused on **scalability** and **improving** the integrated development environment (**IDE**) and **debugging** **capabilities for agents**.
### **LangSmith**
- With the continued growth in **production workloads**, the team remains committed to **enhancing its scalability** as well.
